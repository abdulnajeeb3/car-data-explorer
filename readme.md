# Car Data Explorer

Welcome to the Car Data Explorer project! This project is designed to perform basic data analysis and visualization on a dataset containing information about cars. The project is structured into four main scripts:

1. `data_cleaning.py`: Cleans the raw data.
2. `data_analysis.py`: Analyzes the cleaned data.
3. `data_visualization.py`: Visualizes the results of the analysis.
4. `main.py`: Main script that orchestrates the workflow.
