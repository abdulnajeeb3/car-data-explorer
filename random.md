## Introduction

The Calculator Project is a basic application that demonstrates how to implement and use a simple calculator in Python. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Command-line interface for quick calculations
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience

## Installation

To install the Calculator Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd calculator-project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

To use the calculator via the command-line interface, run the following command:

```bash
python cli_calculator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the operation and the numbers. For example:
```bash
Enter operation (add, sub, mul, div): add
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15
```

### Graphical User Interface

To use the calculator via the graphical user interface, run the following command:

```bash
python gui_calculator.py
```

A window will appear with buttons for each operation and input fields for the numbers. Simply enter the numbers, select the operation, and click the "=" button to see the result.
